    <h2>The crispiest fried chicken is just a few ingredients away when you use this top-rated fried chicken batter!</h2>
    <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make triple-dipped fried chicken at home:</p>
    <p>Make the seasoned flour mixture. <br>
       Make the beer batter. <br>
       Moisten chicken with water, then dip in the seasoned flour.<br>
       Dip the chicken in the batter, then dip it again in the seasoned flour. <br>
       Fry the chicken until it's crispy and well-browned.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul><em>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>4 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups beer, or as needed</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks, beaten</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li></em>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix 3 cups flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, paprika, and poultry seasoning together in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir 1 1/2 cups beer, remaining 1 1/3 cups flour, egg yolks, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in a separate bowl; thin with more beer if batter is too thick.</li>
            <li>Moisten chicken pieces with a little water, then dip in seasoned flour mixture. Shake off excess and dip in beer batter, then dip in the seasoned flour mixture once more.</li>
            <li>Lower chicken pieces carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until crispy and well-browned, about 15 to 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
